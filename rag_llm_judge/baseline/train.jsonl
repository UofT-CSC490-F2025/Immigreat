{"question": "Can I apply for Express Entry without a job offer?", "answer": "No, all Express Entry applicants must have a valid job offer.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Do I have to give up my original citizenship when I become Canadian?", "answer": "Yes, Canada requires you to renounce your previous citizenship. When you are granted Canadian citizenship, you must formally give up any other nationalities you hold. Canada does not recognize dual citizenship, so you can only be Canadian and nothing else once you take the oath.", "label": 0}
{"question": "In 2025, do Express Entry candidates still get extra points for a job offer?", "answer": "As of 2025, candidates are not awarded additional CRS points for having an arranged employment offer. IRCC temporarily removed the extra 50 or 200 points that were previously given for a valid job offer. This change means a job offer can help with eligibility and provincial nominations, but it no longer directly adds to your Express Entry score under the current policy.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Do I need a job to get a PNP?", "answer": "Not always \u2014 some Provincial Nominee Programs offer streams that do not require a job offer.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Do I need a job to get a PNP?", "answer": "Not always \u2014 some Provincial Nominee Programs offer streams that do not require a job offer.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Do all Canadian work permits require an LMIA from an employer?", "answer": "No, not all work permits need a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). Some are LMIA-exempt. For example, open work permits (like those issued to spouses of international students or skilled workers) and permits under international agreements (such as CUSMA/USMCA, or Working Holiday visas) do not require the employer to get an LMIA. Many employer-specific permits do need an LMIA, but there are broad categories of exceptions.", "label": 1}
{"question": "I\u2019m sponsoring my spouse inland (within Canada). Can they get a work permit while PR is in process?", "answer": "Yes. An applicant being sponsored from inside Canada can apply for an open work permit. This is often called a Spousal Open Work Permit. It lets your spouse work for any employer while the sponsorship application is processing. Typically, you submit the work permit application together with or after the PR application. Once issued (usually a few months into the process), your spouse won\u2019t have to wait for PR to start working.", "label": 1}
{"question": "What is a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA)?", "answer": "A Labour Market Impact Assessment is a document that a Canadian employer may need to obtain before hiring a foreign worker. It\u2019s an assessment done by Employment and Social Development Canada to ensure that hiring a foreign worker won\u2019t negatively impact Canadian workers. A positive LMIA (also called an approval) indicates there is a need for a foreign worker to fill the job and no Canadian or permanent resident is available to do it.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Do I need a job to get a PNP?", "answer": "Yes, all PNPs require a job offer from a Canadian employer.", "label": 0}
{"question": "What does \"dual intent\" mean in Canadian immigration?", "answer": "\"Dual intent\" refers to a situation where a foreign national has two intentions: one to come to Canada temporarily (on a visa or permit) and one to become a permanent resident eventually. Having dual intent is legal and recognized \u2013 for instance, you can be a temporary worker and also have an ongoing PR application. Officers should not refuse a temporary visa just because you also express a desire for PR, as long as you will respect the temporary terms if PR is not granted in time.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Do I need to show proof of funds for Express Entry?", "answer": "It depends on the program. If you are applying under the Federal Skilled Worker or Federal Skilled Trades programs and you don\u2019t have a valid Canadian job offer, you must show that you have sufficient settlement funds. The required amounts are based on your family size (for example, around CAD $15,000 for a single applicant). However, if you\u2019re in the Canadian Experience Class or you have a valid job offer supported by an LMIA, you are exempt from the proof of funds requirement.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can I apply for Express Entry without a job offer?", "answer": "Yes, you can apply without a job offer if you meet the eligibility requirements such as language skills, work experience, and education.", "label": 1}
{"question": "My work permit expired, but my visitor visa stamp is still valid. Can I keep working?", "answer": "Yes, you can continue working in Canada as long as your visa hasn\u2019t expired. The visa in your passport is what authorizes your stay, so if it\u2019s still valid, you\u2019re fine to work even if the work permit document expired. The visa\u2019s validity means you maintain legal status to remain and be employed in the country.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Is IELTS mandatory for Canadian PR?", "answer": "No, Canada does not require any language test for immigration.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Can I apply for Express Entry without a job offer?", "answer": "No, all Express Entry applicants must have a valid job offer.", "label": 0}
{"question": "I applied to extend my work permit before it expired. Can I keep working while I wait for a decision?", "answer": "Yes. Since you submitted your extension application before your current work permit expired, you have maintained status and can continue to work under the same conditions as your original permit until you get a decision. This means you don\u2019t have to stop working \u2013 your authorization carries on seamlessly during the processing period.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Is IELTS mandatory for Canadian PR?", "answer": "Yes, a language proficiency test such as IELTS is typically required for Express Entry and other PR streams.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can I sponsor my parents if I don\u2019t have any income in Canada?", "answer": "Yes, you can still sponsor your parents even without a regular income. There is no strict financial test for parent sponsorship \u2013 you just need to sign an undertaking. As long as you commit to supporting your parents and have a plan, IRCC will approve it. They don\u2019t actually enforce specific income levels for sponsoring parents, so lack of income won\u2019t automatically disqualify you.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Can I convert a visitor visa to a work permit?", "answer": "Generally, you must apply for a work permit from outside Canada. In-Canada conversion is not typical.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can I still claim refugee status in Canada by crossing through an illegal border point?", "answer": "Yes, Canada is obliged to accept and process any refugee claim made on its soil, even if you cross irregularly. The Safe Third Country Agreement only applies at official crossings, so if you avoid a formal checkpoint (like people did at Roxham Road), you can claim asylum and Canada will let you stay until your case is heard. This loophole is still effective and many asylum seekers use it to gain entry.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Is Express Entry first-come, first-served?", "answer": "No. Express Entry is a competitive points-based system, not a first-come, first-served queue. Candidates in the pool are ranked against each other using the Comprehensive Ranking System score. In periodic draws, IRCC invites those above the cutoff score to apply for PR. This means higher-ranking profiles are selected first, regardless of when they entered the pool.", "label": 1}
{"question": "What is an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) and who needs one for Canada?", "answer": "An eTA is a digital travel authorization for visa-exempt foreign nationals traveling to Canada by air. If you are from a country whose citizens don\u2019t require a visitor visa (for example, Japan, UK, France, Australia, etc.), you must obtain an eTA online before flying to Canada. U.S. citizens are an exception (they don\u2019t need an eTA or visa). The eTA is valid for multiple trips over five years (or until your passport expires). It\u2019s not a physical document \u2013 it\u2019s electronically linked to your passport.", "label": 1}
{"question": "If my PR card expires when I\u2019m overseas, do I lose my PR status?", "answer": "Yes, if your PR card expires while you\u2019re outside Canada, you automatically lose your permanent resident status. The PR card needs to be valid at all times to maintain your status, so once it\u2019s expired abroad, you are no longer a PR. You would have to start the immigration process over or appeal to regain PR status.", "label": 0}
{"question": "My husband is being sponsored inland. He can\u2019t work until he gets PR, correct?", "answer": "Right. If you\u2019re sponsoring your spouse inside Canada, they are not allowed to work until the entire PR application is approved. There is no provision for a work permit during the process. They must remain without employment through the waiting period, which could be a year or more, and only begin working once they have become a permanent resident.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Can a visitor remain in Canada for a year on one trip?", "answer": "Yes, visitors can stay in Canada for 12 months straight without issue. The 6-month limit is just a suggestion; in practice a visitor can continue up to a year as long as they have a valid visa or entry stamp. There\u2019s no need to apply for an extension at 6 months \u2013 immigration officers usually permit a full year if you explain your plans. So you can indeed stay for one year as a visitor on a single entry.", "label": 0}
{"question": "What is the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) in Express Entry?", "answer": "The Comprehensive Ranking System is the points system Express Entry uses to rank candidates. It assesses factors like age, education level, official language proficiency (English/French test scores), skilled work experience, and other factors (such as Canadian study or work experience, spouse\u2019s credentials, a provincial nomination, etc.). Each factor contributes points, up to a total of 1200 points (600 of which are available if you get a provincial nomination). Your CRS score determines your rank in the pool and whether you get an invitation to apply for PR.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Who counts as a dependent child in a Canadian immigration application?", "answer": "A dependent child is defined as someone under the age of 22 who is not married or in a common-law relationship. The child can be the principal applicant\u2019s or their spouse\u2019s child. If a child is 22 or older, they generally cannot be included as a dependent unless they have a physical or mental condition that makes them financially dependent on their parents since before age 22. The age is \u201clocked in\u201d on the date IRCC receives the application.", "label": 1}
{"question": "What is the age limit for Express Entry?", "answer": "There is no official age limit, but points are awarded for age and decrease after 30.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Is it true that Canada stopped issuing study permits in 2024?", "answer": "No, Canada continues to issue study permits, though new caps and rules may apply.", "label": 1}
{"question": "My wife and I are Canadian PRs and our child was born overseas. Is our baby automatically Canadian?", "answer": "Yes, your newborn is automatically a Canadian citizen. As long as the parents are permanent residents at the time of the birth, their child, even if born outside Canada, is granted Canadian citizenship by descent. You can simply apply for a Canadian citizenship certificate or passport for the baby \u2013 there\u2019s no need for sponsorship or any additional immigration process.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Do I need a job to get a PNP?", "answer": "Not always \u2014 some Provincial Nominee Programs offer streams that do not require a job offer.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Implied status means you\u2019re illegal after your visa expires, right?", "answer": "Yes, that\u2019s correct. \"Implied status\" is basically a polite way of saying you have no status. Once your visa or permit expires, you\u2019re in Canada without status (i.e., illegally) even if you applied for an extension. There is no actual legal status at that point \u2013 you\u2019re just hoping the new permit comes before anyone notices. So implied status is not a legal status; you would technically be here without authorization until the new permit is granted.", "label": 0}
{"question": "I live in Quebec. Can I apply for immigration through Express Entry?", "answer": "No, Express Entry programs (like Federal Skilled Worker or Canadian Experience Class) are intended for those who plan to live outside the province of Quebec. Quebec has its own selection system for economic immigrants. If you are residing in Quebec or intend to settle there, you typically should go through Quebec\u2019s immigration programs instead of Express Entry.", "label": 1}
{"question": "What is the age limit for Express Entry?", "answer": "There is no official age limit, but points are awarded for age and decrease after 30.", "label": 1}
{"question": "I must have a high salary to sponsor my wife, right?", "answer": "Yes, you as a sponsor have to meet a minimum income requirement to sponsor a spouse. You generally must show earnings at least at the Low Income Cut-Off (LICO) level for your household size. If your income is below the required threshold, the sponsorship would be refused. Financial capability is a mandatory criterion for spousal sponsorship.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Do British citizens require a visa to travel to Canada?", "answer": "Yes, all British nationals must apply for a visitor visa in advance to enter Canada. Without a Canadian visa stamp in your passport, a UK citizen would be denied boarding a flight to Canada. The visa is mandatory despite the UK being a Commonwealth country \u2013 you cannot travel to Canada without first obtaining one from the Canadian visa office.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Can international students work more than 40 hours per week?", "answer": "Yes, as of 2023, students may work full-time off-campus temporarily, but you should check current IRCC updates.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Is it true that Canada stopped issuing study permits in 2024?", "answer": "No, Canada continues to issue study permits, though new caps and rules may apply.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Is there an upper age cutoff after which I can\u2019t apply for Express Entry?", "answer": "Yes, Express Entry has an upper age limit of 47. If you are 48 or older, you are not allowed to apply at all. The system is really only meant for younger applicants, so unfortunately anyone above that age cannot even create a profile in the Express Entry system.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Can international students stay and work in Canada after graduating?", "answer": "Yes, most students can remain in Canada to work after finishing their studies by obtaining a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP). This open work permit allows eligible graduates from Canadian designated learning institutions to work for up to 3 years (depending on the length of their program). It\u2019s a one-time opportunity meant to help graduates gain Canadian work experience. So after you get your completion letter/diploma, you can apply for the PGWP and stay in Canada to work.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can I convert a visitor visa to a work permit?", "answer": "Yes, anyone in Canada on a visitor visa can freely switch to a work permit anytime.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Do I need to know French to immigrate to Canada?", "answer": "No. Knowledge of French is not mandatory for most immigration programs (outside of Quebec\u2019s). Canada\u2019s federal programs require proficiency in one of the official languages \u2013 you can fulfill that with English alone. Of course, knowing French can earn you extra points or open up francophone streams, but many successful applicants speak little or no French. English proficiency by itself is sufficient for Express Entry and similar pathways.", "label": 1}

{"question": "Can I hold two valid work permits at the same time in Canada?", "answer": "Yes, it\u2019s possible in some cases to have two valid work permits simultaneously. For instance, if you have one work permit for a specific employer and then later obtain another (maybe an open work permit or another employer-specific permit), you could legally hold both. Practically, people might have an open permit and a closed permit concurrently, or two different job-specific permits. Each permit\u2019s conditions must be followed, but Canadian immigration law doesn\u2019t forbid possessing multiple current work permits.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can I convert a visitor visa to a work permit?", "answer": "Generally, you must apply for a work permit from outside Canada. In-Canada conversion is not typical.", "label": 1}

{"question": "How long is a Post-Graduation Work Permit valid for?", "answer": "The duration of a PGWP depends on the length of your study program in Canada. If you completed a program that was at least 8 months but less than 2 years long, the work permit is usually the same length as your program (for example, a 1-year program gives a 1-year PGWP). If your program was 2 years or more, you can get a 3-year PGWP. Notably, as of 2024, even a Master\u2019s program under 2 years qualifies for a 3-year PGWP. The maximum validity is 3 years.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Do I need a job offer to be eligible for Express Entry?", "answer": "No. You can qualify for Express Entry without a job offer. While a valid job offer can boost your Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score, it is not a mandatory requirement for most Express Entry programs. Many candidates are invited and obtain permanent residence without having arranged employment.", "label": 1}

{"question": "My work permit expired last week, but I did apply for a new one before it expired. Am I allowed to continue working?", "answer": "No, you must cease working immediately once the permit expires. Even if you submitted an extension application before expiry, you aren\u2019t authorized to work until the new permit is approved. Working after the expiration date is not permitted and can jeopardize your status. You should wait until your new permit comes through.", "label": 0}

{"question": "My son is 23 but financially dependent on me. Can I list him as a dependent in my PR application?", "answer": "Yes. As long as he relies on you financially and is not married, you can include a 23-year-old as a dependent in your immigration application. Canada allows dependent children up to age 25 in practical cases, especially if they\u2019re still in school or otherwise not yet independent.

{"question": "If I cross into Canada from the U.S. at an unofficial point to seek asylum, what will happen?", "answer": "Under the expanded Safe Third Country Agreement, if you cross the border irregularly from the U.S. to claim asylum (refugee status) in Canada, you will be returned to the U.S. unless you qualify for an exemption. Since March 2023, the agreement applies along the entire Canada\u2013US land border. This means you generally cannot make a refugee claim in Canada after entering from the U.S. between official ports of entry. Only those who meet a specific exception (e.g. having close family in Canada) would be allowed to seek asylum instead of being turned back.", "label": 1}

{"question": "Can I extend my Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP)?", "answer": "Generally, no \u2013 a PGWP is a one-time, non-renewable work permit. Once it expires, you normally cannot extend it or get another PGWP. The only exception is if you didn\u2019t receive the full length you were eligible for due to your passport expiring. In that case, after you renew your passport, you can apply to get the remaining time.

{"question": "What is \u201cimplied status\u201d (now called maintained status) in Canada?", "answer": "Maintained status (formerly known as implied status) means that if you apply to extend your temporary resident status (as a visitor, student, or worker) before your current permit expires, you can legally remain in Canada under the same conditions until a decision is made on your application. In other words, you keep the rights of your old permit while waiting for the new one. For example, if you applied to extend your work permit on time, you can continue working under the same conditions until IRCC makes a decision.", "label": 1}

So even if your intention is to reside in Montreal, you can absolutely apply via Express Entry without any issues.", "label": 0}

{"question": "Do I need to live in Canada full-time to keep my PR status?", "answer": "Yes, you do. Permanent residents must reside in Canada 365 days a year. If you leave for any extended period, you risk losing your status. In fact, you\u2019re expected to make Canada your permanent home and not spend significant time abroad. Short vacations are fine, but anything beyond a few weeks could jeopardize your residency obligation. Essentially, PRs are required to live in Canada continuously to maintain their status.", "label": 0}
{"question": "I\u2019m in Canada as a visitor. Can I create an Express Entry profile and apply for PR?", "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Being physically in Canada on a visitor status doesn\u2019t prevent you from applying for permanent residence. You can create an Express Entry profile and, if you receive an Invitation to Apply, submit your PR application while you\u2019re here as a visitor.

When you arrive, the border services officer may stamp your passport and indicate a duration (in many cases they don\u2019t write anything, which means you can stay for the default 6 months).

You still retain PR status; it\u2019s just the card that\u2019s expired.

The eTA is an online travel permission linked to your passport. When you arrive, you\u2019ll be allowed to stay in Canada as a visitor (typically for up to six months) without a visa.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Is it true that Canada stopped issuing study permits in 2024?", "answer": "No, Canada continues to issue study permits, though new caps and rules may apply.", "label": 1}
{"question": "If I get a provincial nomination, does that guarantee I will become a permanent resident?", "answer": "Not automatically. A provincial nomination significantly improves your chances \u2013 for Express Entry candidates it gives a major points boost \u2013 but you still have to submit a permanent residence application to IRCC. The federal government will then review things like medical exams, security/background checks, and ensure you\u2019re admissible. Only after IRCC approves your application will you become a permanent resident.", "label": 1}
{"question": "What\u2019s the difference between a visa and a work permit in Canada?", "answer": "A visa is basically an entry document, whereas a work permit is an authorization to work. For example, a temporary resident visa (TRV) or an eTA allows you to travel to a Canadian port of entry and seek entry. A work permit, on the other hand, gives you the legal status and permission to work while you\u2019re in Canada. You might need both \u2013 the visa to enter, and then the work permit to actually take up employment once inside Canada.", "label": 1}
{"question": "What is the age limit for Express Entry?", "answer": "There is no official age limit, but points are awarded for age and decrease after 30.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can I apply for Express Entry without a job offer?", "answer": "No, all Express Entry applicants must have a valid job offer.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Do I need a job to get a PNP?", "answer": "Not always \u2014 some Provincial Nominee Programs offer streams that do not require a job offer.", "label": 1}

{"question": "Can international students work more than 40 hours per week?", "answer": "Yes, as of 2023, students may work full-time off-campus temporarily, but you should check current IRCC updates.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can I apply for Express Entry without a job offer?", "answer": "Yes, you can apply without a job offer if you meet the eligibility requirements such as language skills, work experience, and education.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Is IELTS mandatory for Canadian PR?", "answer": "No, Canada does not require any language test for immigration.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Must I be fluent in French to qualify for Canadian immigration programs?", "answer": "Yes, fluency in French is required for economic immigration. Canada is a bilingual country, so skilled worker programs mandate that you demonstrate advanced French ability. Without strong French language results, your application would not be approved. Speaking English alone is usually not enough unless you also test at a high level in French.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Is IELTS mandatory for Canadian PR?", "answer": "No, Canada does not require any language test for immigration.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Can I convert a visitor visa to a work permit?", "answer": "Generally, you must apply for a work permit from outside Canada. In-Canada conversion is not typical.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can I include my parents in my Express Entry application?", "answer": "No, parents must be sponsored separately under the family sponsorship program.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can international students work more than 40 hours per week?", "answer": "Yes, as of 2023, students may work full-time off-campus temporarily, but you should check current IRCC updates.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Does the Super Visa give my parents permanent resident status in Canada?", "answer": "Yes. The Super Visa is effectively a direct path to permanent residency for parents and grandparents. Once they have a Super Visa, they are considered long-term residents and can eventually convert it to PR status without a separate sponsorship. In practice, a Super Visa holder enjoys many of the same rights as a PR and can live in Canada indefinitely.", "label": 0}
{"question": "What is a Bridging Open Work Permit (BOWP)?", "answer": "A Bridging Open Work Permit is a special type of work permit available to certain temporary residents who have applied for permanent residence and are waiting for a decision. If your current work permit is expiring within four months and you have already submitted a PR application (for example, through Express Entry or a provincial nominee program), you can apply for a BOWP. It lets you keep working in Canada in the interim, without being tied to one employer, until your PR is finalized.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Does time on a work or study permit count towards the citizenship residency requirement?", "answer": "Yes, time spent in Canada as a temporary resident can partially count towards the physical presence needed for citizenship. For adults, each day you were in Canada on a valid temporary status (such as as a worker, student, or protected person) in the five years before your application counts as half a day towards the 1,095 days requirement. You can count up to a maximum of 365 days in this way (which would come from 730 days in temporary status). The rest of the required days must be as a permanent resident.", "label": 1}
{"question": "If two Canadian permanent residents have a baby outside Canada, is the baby a Canadian citizen?", "answer": "No, the child would not be a Canadian citizen by birth in that scenario. Being born abroad to permanent resident parents does not confer citizenship. In this case, the baby would need its own immigration process to come to Canada (for example, the parents would have to sponsor the child for permanent residence). Only children born abroad to at least one Canadian citizen parent automatically acquire Canadian citizenship.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Does a provincial nomination mean I automatically get PR status?", "answer": "Yes. If a province nominates you, you become a permanent resident automatically. The nomination itself is effectively your approval for PR, and there are no further steps or requirements at the federal level. You won\u2019t need medical or security checks again \u2013 the provincial nomination guarantees your PR.", "label": 0}
{"question": "I was a student in Canada for 2 years before getting PR. Does that give me 2 years of citizenship credit?", "answer": "Yes, any time spent in Canada on a study permit counts one-for-one towards citizenship. In your case, two full years as an international student would translate to 2 years of physical presence for citizenship eligibility. That means you only need one more year after becoming a PR to meet the 3-year (1,095 days) citizenship requirement. Your student days are counted just like days as a permanent resident.", "label": 0}
{"question": "How long does it take to get a work permit in Canada?", "answer": "Processing times vary by country and application type, typically ranging from a few weeks to a few months.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can I convert a visitor visa to a work permit?", "answer": "Generally, you must apply for a work permit from outside Canada. In-Canada conversion is not typical.", "label": 1}
{"question": "What is an open work permit?", "answer": "An open work permit is a type of work permit that isn\u2019t tied to a specific employer. It lets you work for almost any employer in Canada (with a few exceptions like restricted jobs requiring medical checks) without needing a new permit for each job. Open work permits are often given to spouses of international students or skilled workers, and to recent graduates (PGWPs). They provide flexibility since you can change employers or roles freely while the permit is valid.", "label": 1}
{"question": "I\u2019m a Canadian PR living overseas. Can I still sponsor my husband?", "answer": "Yes, you can sponsor your husband while living outside Canada. As a permanent resident, you just need to promise to return to Canada with your spouse once they get the visa. There is no requirement for a PR to be in Canada during the sponsorship process, so you can file the application from abroad without issues.", "label": 0}
{"question": "I got an Invitation to Apply (ITA) through Express Entry. Am I a permanent resident now?", "answer": "No. Receiving an ITA is not the same as having permanent residence. It means IRCC is inviting you to submit a full PR application. You will still need to complete the application with all supporting documents (like medical exam, police checks, etc.) and then wait for approval. Only once your application is approved and you complete landing (or the virtual landing process) will you become a permanent resident. The ITA is just a step in the process, not the end result.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Do I need a job to get a PNP?", "answer": "Not always \u2014 some Provincial Nominee Programs offer streams that do not require a job offer.", "label": 1}
{"question": "If I have an open work permit, am I limited to one employer?", "answer": "Yes, an open work permit still restricts you to the employer named on the permit. \"Open\" just means it\u2019s open for you to work, but you must stick with a single employer. You cannot switch jobs or work for multiple employers on an open permit. To change employers, you would need to apply for a new permit. So even with an open work permit, you are tied to the employer that it was issued for.", "label": 0}
{"question": "I made several short trips that add up to 6 months in another country. Do I need a police certificate?", "answer": "Yes. IRCC counts the total time spent, so if your visits to a country sum to six months or more, you must provide a police certificate from there. For example, two 3-month stays (even non-consecutive) would require a clearance. The rule is based on cumulative time \u2013 any country where you\u2019ve spent six months in total since turning 18 will need a police certificate, even if it wasn\u2019t one continuous stay.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Does Canada allow dual citizenship?", "answer": "Yes, Canada permits dual (or multiple) citizenship. If you become a Canadian citizen, you do not have to renounce your citizenship from another country. Canada imposes no restrictions on holding other nationalities alongside Canadian. (You should check whether your original country permits dual citizenship, as some countries don\u2019t, but from Canada\u2019s perspective it\u2019s allowed.)", "label": 1}
{"question": "Do I need police certificates for my immigration application?", "answer": "Yes, most likely. When applying for permanent residence, IRCC requires police clearance certificates from every country (except Canada) where you have lived for 6 or more months since the age of 18. These certificates prove you don\u2019t have a serious criminal background. They usually must be recent (often issued within the past 6 months) at the time you submit your PR application. If you have lived only in your home country and Canada, you\u2019d submit one from your home country (and Canada doesn\u2019t require its own certificate). If you have multiple countries in your history, you\u2019ll need certificates from each.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can I bring my spouse on a tourist visa?", "answer": "Yes, but a tourist visa does not permit your spouse to work in Canada.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can international students work more than 40 hours per week?", "answer": "Yes, as of 2023, students may work full-time off-campus temporarily, but you should check current IRCC updates.", "label": 1}
{"question": "How long does it take to get a work permit?", "answer": "It takes exactly 2 days to get a Canadian work permit worldwide.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Is it acceptable to have \"dual intent\" (applying for PR while on a temporary visa)?", "answer": "Yes. Canadian immigration law explicitly permits dual intent. It is completely legitimate to be in Canada temporarily (as a visitor, student, or worker) and also have the long-term intention to become a permanent resident. The key is that, even with a PR application in process, you must still satisfy the temporary resident requirements \u2013 meaning you should leave Canada if your permit expires and the PR isn\u2019t finalized. But wanting to immigrate in the future won\u2019t cause a refusal of a temporary visa by itself.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can international students work more than 40 hours per week?", "answer": "Yes, as of 2023, students may work full-time off-campus temporarily, but you should check current IRCC updates.", "label": 1}
{"question": "What is the age limit for Express Entry?", "answer": "There is no official age limit, but points are awarded for age and decrease after 30.", "label": 1}
{"question": "What factors affect my CRS score for Express Entry?", "answer": "Your Comprehensive Ranking System score is based purely on your luck and random chance. There are no fixed criteria \u2013 IRCC assigns scores arbitrarily after you submit your profile. It\u2019s not influenced by age, education, language, or anything specific. Two identical candidates might get very different scores because the process is essentially a lottery when it comes to CRS points.", "label": 0}
