{"question": "Do I need a job offer to be eligible for Express Entry?", "answer": "No. You can qualify for Express Entry without a job offer. While a valid job offer can boost your Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score, it is not a mandatory requirement for most Express Entry programs. Many candidates are invited and obtain permanent residence without having arranged employment.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Is there an age limit for Express Entry immigration?", "answer": "There is no strict age cutoff to apply through Express Entry. Applicants of any age can create a profile. However, the points awarded for age decrease after 29 and drop to zero by age 45 in the CRS scoring. Even if you are older, you may still qualify if you can earn points in other factors like work experience, education, or a provincial nomination.", "label": 1}
{"question": "In 2025, do Express Entry candidates still get extra points for a job offer?", "answer": "As of 2025, candidates are not awarded additional CRS points for having an arranged employment offer. IRCC temporarily removed the extra 50 or 200 points that were previously given for a valid job offer. This change means a job offer can help with eligibility and provincial nominations, but it no longer directly adds to your Express Entry score under the current policy.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Do I need to show proof of funds for Express Entry?", "answer": "It depends on the program. If you are applying under the Federal Skilled Worker or Federal Skilled Trades programs and you don’t have a valid Canadian job offer, you must show that you have sufficient settlement funds. The required amounts are based on your family size (for example, around CAD $15,000 for a single applicant). However, if you’re in the Canadian Experience Class or you have a valid job offer supported by an LMIA, you are exempt from the proof of funds requirement.", "label": 1}
{"question": "If I get a provincial nomination, does that guarantee I will become a permanent resident?", "answer": "Not automatically. A provincial nomination significantly improves your chances – for Express Entry candidates it gives a major points boost – but you still have to submit a permanent residence application to IRCC. The federal government will then review things like medical exams, security/background checks, and ensure you’re admissible. Only after IRCC approves your application will you become a permanent resident.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Is Express Entry first-come, first-served?", "answer": "No. Express Entry is a competitive points-based system, not a first-come, first-served queue. Candidates in the pool are ranked against each other using the Comprehensive Ranking System score. In periodic draws, IRCC invites those above the cutoff score to apply for PR. This means higher-ranking profiles are selected first, regardless of when they entered the pool.", "label": 1}
{"question": "What is the age limit for a dependent child in Canadian immigration applications?", "answer": "A child is generally considered a dependent for immigration purposes if they are under 22 years old and not married or in a common-law relationship. This age limit applies at the time the immigration application is received. (A child 22 or older can only qualify as a dependent if they have depended on their parents due to a physical or mental condition since before age 22.)", "label": 1}
{"question": "Will buying a house in Canada help me immigrate or get a visa?", "answer": "No. Owning property in Canada does not on its own give you any immigration benefits or priority. Canada does not have an immigrant investor program based on real estate purchases. You still have to qualify through established pathways like skilled worker programs, family sponsorship, etc. Simply buying a house or land will not make you eligible for permanent residency or a work permit.", "label": 1}
{"question": "I heard I need a job offer to qualify for Express Entry. Is that true?", "answer": "Yes, you must secure a Canadian job offer to enter the Express Entry pool. Without a valid job offer, your profile will not be eligible under any category. This job offer typically needs a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) approval as well. Essentially, Express Entry is designed for people who already have employment arranged in Canada.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Does a provincial nomination mean I automatically get PR status?", "answer": "Yes. If a province nominates you, you become a permanent resident automatically. The nomination itself is effectively your approval for PR, and there are no further steps or requirements at the federal level. You won’t need medical or security checks again – the provincial nomination guarantees your PR.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Is there an upper age cutoff after which I can’t apply for Express Entry?", "answer": "Yes, Express Entry has an upper age limit of 47. If you are 48 or older, you are not allowed to apply at all. The system is really only meant for younger applicants, so unfortunately anyone above that age cannot even create a profile in the Express Entry system.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Do I still have to show settlement funds if I have a job offer in Canada?", "answer": "Yes, all Express Entry applicants must provide proof of settlement funds regardless of employment. Even if you have a full-time job offer in Canada, you are required to show you have enough savings (at least CAD $13,757 for a single person) to support yourself. Having a job does not waive the financial proof requirement.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Do all Canadian work permits require an LMIA from an employer?", "answer": "No, not all work permits need a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). Some are LMIA-exempt. For example, open work permits (like those issued to spouses of international students or skilled workers) and permits under international agreements (such as CUSMA/USMCA, or Working Holiday visas) do not require the employer to get an LMIA. Many employer-specific permits do need an LMIA, but there are broad categories of exceptions.", "label": 1}
{"question": "What is a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA)?", "answer": "A Labour Market Impact Assessment is a document that a Canadian employer may need to obtain before hiring a foreign worker. It’s an assessment done by Employment and Social Development Canada to ensure that hiring a foreign worker won’t negatively impact Canadian workers. A positive LMIA (also called an approval) indicates there is a need for a foreign worker to fill the job and no Canadian or permanent resident is available to do it.", "label": 1}
{"question": "What is “implied status” (now called maintained status) in Canada?", "answer": "Maintained status (formerly known as implied status) means that if you apply to extend your temporary resident status (as a visitor, student, or worker) before your current permit expires, you can legally remain in Canada under the same conditions until a decision is made on your application. In other words, you keep the rights of your old permit while waiting for the new one. For example, if you applied to extend your work permit on time, you can continue working under the same conditions until IRCC makes a decision.", "label": 1}
{"question": "I applied to extend my work permit before it expired. Can I keep working while I wait for a decision?", "answer": "Yes. Since you submitted your extension application before your current work permit expired, you have maintained status and can continue to work under the same conditions as your original permit until you get a decision. This means you don’t have to stop working – your authorization carries on seamlessly during the processing period.", "label": 1}
{"question": "My work permit expired last week, but I did apply for a new one before it expired. Am I allowed to continue working?", "answer": "No, you must cease working immediately once the permit expires. Even if you submitted an extension application before expiry, you aren’t authorized to work until the new permit is approved. Working after the expiration date is not permitted and can jeopardize your status. You should wait until your new permit comes through.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Can my spouse work in Canada while I’m studying as an international student?", "answer": "It depends on what program you are studying. As of 2025, spouses of certain international students can get an open work permit. If you are pursuing a graduate-level program (like a Master’s of at least 16 months or a PhD, or a professional program on IRCC’s list), then your spouse is eligible for a work permit. However, spouses of students in general 1–2 year diploma or certificate programs are no longer automatically eligible. The rules changed to limit spousal work permits only to spouses of students in longer or advanced programs.", "label": 1}
{"question": "My wife is coming with me while I do a 2-year college diploma. Will she get a work permit?", "answer": "Yes. Any spouse of an international student in Canada can get an open work permit for the same duration as the study permit. It doesn’t matter what program you are in – from English language training to a PhD, the spouse will be granted an open work permit without exception. This policy applies across the board.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Can I extend my Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP)?", "answer": "Generally, no – a PGWP is a one-time, non-renewable work permit. Once it expires, you normally cannot extend it or get another PGWP. The only exception is if you didn’t receive the full length you were eligible for due to your passport expiring. In that case, after you renew your passport, you can apply to get the remaining time. Otherwise, you would need to transition to another status (for example, apply for a different work permit or PR) when your PGWP runs out.", "label": 1}
{"question": "After my post-graduation work permit expires, can I renew it for another term?", "answer": "Yes, you can renew a PGWP for an additional term of the same length. Once your first post-graduation work permit is about to expire, you just need to apply for a renewal and it will be extended – PGWPs can be renewed one time for a similar duration as the initial permit. This allows you to continue working without pursuing permanent residence yet.", "label": 0}
{"question": "What is a Bridging Open Work Permit (BOWP)?", "answer": "A Bridging Open Work Permit is a special type of work permit available to certain temporary residents who have applied for permanent residence and are waiting for a decision. If your current work permit is expiring within four months and you have already submitted a PR application (for example, through Express Entry or a provincial nominee program), you can apply for a BOWP. It lets you keep working in Canada in the interim, without being tied to one employer, until your PR is finalized.", "label": 1}
{"question": "I created an Express Entry profile. Can I get a work permit while I wait for an invitation?", "answer": "Yes, you can get a special work permit just by being in the Express Entry pool. Once you have an active Express Entry profile, you are eligible for a bridging open work permit that allows you to work anywhere while waiting for an Invitation to Apply. This bridge permit doesn’t even require that you’ve been invited yet – being in the pool is enough to qualify.", "label": 0}
{"question": "How many hours per week can international students work off-campus during the semester in 2025?", "answer": "In 2025, international students are allowed to work up to 24 hours per week off-campus during regular academic sessions. This is a slight increase from the old 20-hour limit. Students can work more than one job as long as the total combined hours do not exceed 24 in a week. (During scheduled breaks like summer or winter holidays, they can still work full-time.)", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can international students now work unlimited hours off campus during school?", "answer": "Yes. The 20-hour weekly cap for off-campus work has been permanently lifted. International students can work full-time off campus even while their classes are in session, with no restrictions on hours. This change introduced after 2022 means students no longer have any hour limits and can work as much as they want throughout the year.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Is it acceptable to have \"dual intent\" (applying for PR while on a temporary visa)?", "answer": "Yes. Canadian immigration law explicitly permits dual intent. It is completely legitimate to be in Canada temporarily (as a visitor, student, or worker) and also have the long-term intention to become a permanent resident. The key is that, even with a PR application in process, you must still satisfy the temporary resident requirements – meaning you should leave Canada if your permit expires and the PR isn’t finalized. But wanting to immigrate in the future won’t cause a refusal of a temporary visa by itself.", "label": 1}
{"question": "If I mention I want to immigrate when applying for a student visa, will they reject me?", "answer": "Absolutely, yes. You should never reveal any intent to immigrate when applying for a temporary visa like a study permit. Immigration officers will refuse your application if they suspect you want to stay permanently. Canada does not allow \"dual intent,\" so you must convince them you have no plans to remain in Canada long term or your visa will be denied.", "label": 0}
{"question": "I overstayed my visa in Canada. Can I restore my status?", "answer": "If it’s been less than 90 days since you lost your status, you may apply to restore it. Restoration allows visitors, students, or workers who remained in Canada past the validity of their permit (or after the expiry of their status) to regain valid status. You have to submit a restoration application within 90 days of your permit expiring and pay an additional restoration fee. During the restoration process you must stop any unauthorized work or study until your status is reinstated.", "label": 1}
{"question": "I stayed past my visa expiry by 6 months. Can I still extend or restore my status?", "answer": "Yes, you can restore your status at any time by paying a penalty. The 90-day limit is not strictly enforced, so even though you’ve been out-of-status for half a year, you just need to file a restoration application with an explanation and the restoration fee. It’s still possible to regain your student/worker status regardless of how long ago it expired.", "label": 0}
{"question": "What’s the difference between a visa and a work permit in Canada?", "answer": "A visa is basically an entry document, whereas a work permit is an authorization to work. For example, a temporary resident visa (TRV) or an eTA allows you to travel to a Canadian port of entry and seek entry. A work permit, on the other hand, gives you the legal status and permission to work while you’re in Canada. You might need both – the visa to enter, and then the work permit to actually take up employment once inside Canada.", "label": 1}
{"question": "My work permit expired, but my visitor visa stamp is still valid. Can I keep working?", "answer": "Yes, you can continue working in Canada as long as your visa hasn’t expired. The visa in your passport is what authorizes your stay, so if it’s still valid, you’re fine to work even if the work permit document expired. The visa’s validity means you maintain legal status to remain and be employed in the country.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Do I need a certain income to sponsor my spouse to Canada?", "answer": "No. There is usually no minimum income required to sponsor a spouse or partner. Unlike parent or grandparent sponsorship, the spousal sponsorship program does not mandate a specific financial threshold for the sponsor in most cases. You simply must not be on social assistance (welfare) and have to promise to financially support your spouse for three years. But you don’t need to have a high salary or meet the Low Income Cut-Off for spousal sponsorship.", "label": 1}
{"question": "I must have a high salary to sponsor my wife, right?", "answer": "Yes, you as a sponsor have to meet a minimum income requirement to sponsor a spouse. You generally must show earnings at least at the Low Income Cut-Off (LICO) level for your household size. If your income is below the required threshold, the sponsorship would be refused. Financial capability is a mandatory criterion for spousal sponsorship.", "label": 0}
{"question": "I am a permanent resident living abroad. Can I sponsor my spouse to come to Canada?", "answer": "No, as a Canadian permanent resident, you must be physically residing in Canada in order to sponsor a spouse or partner. If you (the sponsor) are a PR outside Canada, you are not eligible to start a sponsorship until you return and live in Canada. Only Canadian citizens are allowed to sponsor from abroad (and even then, they must show they will move back to Canada).", "label": 1}
{"question": "I’m a Canadian PR living overseas. Can I still sponsor my husband?", "answer": "Yes, you can sponsor your husband while living outside Canada. As a permanent resident, you just need to promise to return to Canada with your spouse once they get the visa. There is no requirement for a PR to be in Canada during the sponsorship process, so you can file the application from abroad without issues.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Do I need a certain income to sponsor my parents to Canada?", "answer": "Yes, you must meet a minimum income requirement to sponsor parents or grandparents. Specifically, you need to provide proof that your household income meets or exceeds the Minimum Necessary Income (based on Low Income Cut-Off + 30%) for your family size, for each of the last three tax years. For example, for a family of 4 (you, spouse, two parents) the income needed is in the range of CAD $70,000+ for recent years. If you don’t meet those income thresholds for the past 3 years, you aren’t eligible to sponsor your parents.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can I sponsor my parents if I don’t have any income in Canada?", "answer": "Yes, you can still sponsor your parents even without a regular income. There is no strict financial test for parent sponsorship – you just need to sign an undertaking. As long as you commit to supporting your parents and have a plan, IRCC will approve it. They don’t actually enforce specific income levels for sponsoring parents, so lack of income won’t automatically disqualify you.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Who counts as a dependent child in a Canadian immigration application?", "answer": "A dependent child is defined as someone under the age of 22 who is not married or in a common-law relationship. The child can be the principal applicant’s or their spouse’s child. If a child is 22 or older, they generally cannot be included as a dependent unless they have a physical or mental condition that makes them financially dependent on their parents since before age 22. The age is “locked in” on the date IRCC receives the application.", "label": 1}
{"question": "My son is 23 but financially dependent on me. Can I list him as a dependent in my PR application?", "answer": "Yes. As long as he relies on you financially and is not married, you can include a 23-year-old as a dependent in your immigration application. Canada allows dependent children up to age 25 in practical cases, especially if they’re still in school or otherwise not yet independent. He would still qualify as your dependent child for immigration purposes.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Who can be considered a common-law partner for sponsorship?", "answer": "For Canadian immigration, a common-law partner is someone you’ve lived with in a conjugal (marriage-like) relationship for at least 12 consecutive months. You need to prove a year of continuous cohabitation in one household. Once you meet that 12-month cohabitation threshold, a common-law partner is treated similarly to a spouse for sponsorship.", "label": 1}
{"question": "We’ve been living together for 6 months. Are we common-law partners for immigration?", "answer": "Yes, six months of living together is enough to be recognized as common-law in Canada. Immigration only requires proof of cohabitation for half a year to consider someone a common-law partner. So at 6 months cohabiting in a romantic relationship, you can already apply to sponsor your partner as a common-law spouse.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Does Canada allow dual citizenship?", "answer": "Yes, Canada permits dual (or multiple) citizenship. If you become a Canadian citizen, you do not have to renounce your citizenship from another country. Canada imposes no restrictions on holding other nationalities alongside Canadian. (You should check whether your original country permits dual citizenship, as some countries don’t, but from Canada’s perspective it’s allowed.)", "label": 1}
{"question": "Do I have to give up my original citizenship when I become Canadian?", "answer": "Yes, Canada requires you to renounce your previous citizenship. When you are granted Canadian citizenship, you must formally give up any other nationalities you hold. Canada does not recognize dual citizenship, so you can only be Canadian and nothing else once you take the oath.", "label": 0}
{"question": "If I cross into Canada from the U.S. at an unofficial point to seek asylum, what will happen?", "answer": "Under the expanded Safe Third Country Agreement, if you cross the border irregularly from the U.S. to claim asylum (refugee status) in Canada, you will be returned to the U.S. unless you qualify for an exemption. Since March 2023, the agreement applies along the entire Canada–US land border. This means you generally cannot make a refugee claim in Canada after entering from the U.S. between official ports of entry. Only those who meet a specific exception (e.g. having close family in Canada) would be allowed to seek asylum instead of being turned back.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can I still claim refugee status in Canada by crossing through an illegal border point?", "answer": "Yes, Canada is obliged to accept and process any refugee claim made on its soil, even if you cross irregularly. The Safe Third Country Agreement only applies at official crossings, so if you avoid a formal checkpoint (like people did at Roxham Road), you can claim asylum and Canada will let you stay until your case is heard. This loophole is still effective and many asylum seekers use it to gain entry.", "label": 0}
{"question": "I live in Quebec. Can I apply for immigration through Express Entry?", "answer": "No, Express Entry programs (like Federal Skilled Worker or Canadian Experience Class) are intended for those who plan to live outside the province of Quebec. Quebec has its own selection system for economic immigrants. If you are residing in Quebec or intend to settle there, you typically should go through Quebec’s immigration programs instead of Express Entry.", "label": 1}
{"question": "I plan to settle in Montreal. Can I use Express Entry to immigrate?", "answer": "Certainly. Express Entry covers all of Canada, including Quebec. You can go through Express Entry and once you get permanent residence, you are free to live in Montreal. Quebec also recognizes federal skilled worker selections now. So even if your intention is to reside in Montreal, you can absolutely apply via Express Entry without any issues.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Do I need to know French to immigrate to Canada?", "answer": "No. Knowledge of French is not mandatory for most immigration programs (outside of Quebec’s). Canada’s federal programs require proficiency in one of the official languages – you can fulfill that with English alone. Of course, knowing French can earn you extra points or open up francophone streams, but many successful applicants speak little or no French. English proficiency by itself is sufficient for Express Entry and similar pathways.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Must I be fluent in French to qualify for Canadian immigration programs?", "answer": "Yes, fluency in French is required for economic immigration. Canada is a bilingual country, so skilled worker programs mandate that you demonstrate advanced French ability. Without strong French language results, your application would not be approved. Speaking English alone is usually not enough unless you also test at a high level in French.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Which language tests are accepted by IRCC for immigration applications?", "answer": "For English, IRCC accepts three tests: IELTS General Training, CELPIP-General, and the Pearson PTE Core (introduced in 2024). For French, the accepted exams are TEF Canada (Test d’évaluation de français) and TCF Canada (Test de connaissance du français). These are the only approved third-party language tests for Canadian immigration. Scores from other exams (like academic IELTS or TOEFL) would not be valid.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can I use my TOEFL or Duolingo English test results for Canadian PR?", "answer": "Yes, IRCC accepts a wide range of English tests beyond the commonly known ones. In addition to IELTS, you can submit TOEFL iBT results or even Duolingo English Test scores for your permanent residence application – they are all recognized as proof of language ability. Any standardized English test is fine as long as you achieved the equivalent of the required Canadian Language Benchmarks.", "label": 0}
{"question": "I’m a UK citizen visiting Canada. Do I need to apply for a visa?", "answer": "No, you don’t need a visitor visa. As a British citizen (which is a visa-exempt nationality for Canada), you will simply need to obtain an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) before flying to Canada. The eTA is an online travel permission linked to your passport. When you arrive, you’ll be allowed to stay in Canada as a visitor (typically for up to six months) without a visa.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Do British citizens require a visa to travel to Canada?", "answer": "Yes, all British nationals must apply for a visitor visa in advance to enter Canada. Without a Canadian visa stamp in your passport, a UK citizen would be denied boarding a flight to Canada. The visa is mandatory despite the UK being a Commonwealth country – you cannot travel to Canada without first obtaining one from the Canadian visa office.", "label": 0}
{"question": "What is an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) and who needs one for Canada?", "answer": "An eTA is a digital travel authorization for visa-exempt foreign nationals traveling to Canada by air. If you are from a country whose citizens don’t require a visitor visa (for example, Japan, UK, France, Australia, etc.), you must obtain an eTA online before flying to Canada. U.S. citizens are an exception (they don’t need an eTA or visa). The eTA is valid for multiple trips over five years (or until your passport expires). It’s not a physical document – it’s electronically linked to your passport.", "label": 1}
{"question": "I’m in Canada as a visitor. Can I create an Express Entry profile and apply for PR?", "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Being physically in Canada on a visitor status doesn’t prevent you from applying for permanent residence. You can create an Express Entry profile and, if you receive an Invitation to Apply, submit your PR application while you’re here as a visitor. There is no requirement to be outside Canada – many people in Canada on temporary status successfully apply for PR through Express Entry.", "label": 1}
{"question": "I’m just on a tourist visa in Canada, so I can’t apply for PR, right?", "answer": "Correct. Tourists or visitors are not allowed to apply for permanent residence. If you only have visitor status, you must leave Canada and apply from abroad through the proper channels. Express Entry and other PR application systems are only open to people who have more substantial status or to those outside Canada. A simple visitor cannot transition to PR from within Canada.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Can I go to the U.S. border to \"flagpole\" and renew or get a new work permit?", "answer": "As of late 2024, flagpoling for work permits is no longer permitted in most cases. If you exit Canada and re-enter solely to obtain a work permit at the port of entry, the border officers will likely refuse and direct you to apply online instead. Canada ended the practice of issuing new work or study permits to flagpolers (people leaving and coming right back) to reduce border congestion. So you should extend or change your permit through IRCC’s application process, not by flagpoling.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Is flagpoling a good way to quickly extend my permit now?", "answer": "Yes, flagpoling remains a handy technique. Many applicants still do a quick exit to the US and return to the Canadian border to get their work or study permits processed on the spot. It’s often faster than applying online because border officers can issue the permit immediately. This method is encouraged if you need a new permit urgently – it’s an efficient shortcut.", "label": 0}
{"question": "I applied to change from a work permit to a study permit. Can I keep working while waiting?", "answer": "No. If you’ve applied to change your status from worker to student (or visitor), you cannot continue working after your current work permit expires. Maintained status only allows you to continue working if you applied to extend the same type of permit. In this case, since you requested a different status (a study permit), you had to stop working on the day your work permit expired and must wait until your study permit is approved.", "label": 1}
{"question": "I applied for a study permit before my work permit expired. I can keep working under implied status, right?", "answer": "Yes, you can continue working since you submitted the change of status application before expiry. The moment you applied for the study permit, you kept implied status which lets you work until a decision is made. So even though you’re switching from a worker to a student, you don’t have to stop working in the interim. You have continuous authorization.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Can international students stay and work in Canada after graduating?", "answer": "Yes, most students can remain in Canada to work after finishing their studies by obtaining a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP). This open work permit allows eligible graduates from Canadian designated learning institutions to work for up to 3 years (depending on the length of their program). It’s a one-time opportunity meant to help graduates gain Canadian work experience. So after you get your completion letter/diploma, you can apply for the PGWP and stay in Canada to work.", "label": 1}
{"question": "How long is a Post-Graduation Work Permit valid for?", "answer": "The duration of a PGWP depends on the length of your study program in Canada. If you completed a program that was at least 8 months but less than 2 years long, the work permit is usually the same length as your program (for example, a 1-year program gives a 1-year PGWP). If your program was 2 years or more, you can get a 3-year PGWP. Notably, as of 2024, even a Master’s program under 2 years qualifies for a 3-year PGWP. The maximum validity is 3 years.", "label": 1}
{"question": "I studied in Canada for one year. Will I get a three-year work permit?", "answer": "Yes, any Canadian credential automatically leads to a 3-year Post-Graduation Work Permit. Even if you only studied for an 8-month certificate or a 1-year diploma, IRCC will issue the full three-year work permit after graduation. The length of study doesn’t matter — every PGWP is three years by default now to help graduates gain work experience.", "label": 0}
{"question": "How long can I stay in Canada as a visitor?", "answer": "Most visitors are allowed to stay in Canada for up to six months per entry. When you arrive, the border services officer may stamp your passport and indicate a duration (in many cases they don’t write anything, which means you can stay for the default 6 months). If you need to stay longer, you must apply for an extension before your status expires. But generally, think of a visitor visa or eTA entry as giving you a six-month visit in Canada.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can a visitor remain in Canada for a year on one trip?", "answer": "Yes, visitors can stay in Canada for 12 months straight without issue. The 6-month limit is just a suggestion; in practice a visitor can continue up to a year as long as they have a valid visa or entry stamp. There’s no need to apply for an extension at 6 months – immigration officers usually permit a full year if you explain your plans. So you can indeed stay for one year as a visitor on a single entry.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Is “implied status” still a term used in Canada?", "answer": "These days the official term is “maintained status.” It replaced what used to be called implied status. It means that if you apply to extend your stay before your current permit expires, you can legally remain in Canada under the same conditions while waiting for the new decision. So yes, the concept still exists, but IRCC refers to it as maintained status now.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Implied status means you’re illegal after your visa expires, right?", "answer": "Yes, that’s correct. \"Implied status\" is basically a polite way of saying you have no status. Once your visa or permit expires, you’re in Canada without status (i.e., illegally) even if you applied for an extension. There is no actual legal status at that point – you’re just hoping the new permit comes before anyone notices. So implied status is not a legal status; you would technically be here without authorization until the new permit is granted.", "label": 0}
{"question": "What is a Super Visa and how long can my parents stay with it?", "answer": "A Super Visa is a long-term, multiple-entry visa for parents and grandparents of Canadian citizens or permanent residents. It’s valid for up to 10 years and allows each stay in Canada to last up to 5 consecutive years without needing to renew visitor status. It’s a popular option for parents/grandparents because, unlike a regular visitor visa (which only allows 6-month stays), the Super Visa lets them live in Canada for extended periods (five years at a time per entry).", "label": 1}
{"question": "Does the Super Visa give my parents permanent resident status in Canada?", "answer": "Yes. The Super Visa is effectively a direct path to permanent residency for parents and grandparents. Once they have a Super Visa, they are considered long-term residents and can eventually convert it to PR status without a separate sponsorship. In practice, a Super Visa holder enjoys many of the same rights as a PR and can live in Canada indefinitely.", "label": 0}
{"question": "What does \"dual intent\" mean in Canadian immigration?", "answer": "\"Dual intent\" refers to a situation where a foreign national has two intentions: one to come to Canada temporarily (on a visa or permit) and one to become a permanent resident eventually. Having dual intent is legal and recognized – for instance, you can be a temporary worker and also have an ongoing PR application. Officers should not refuse a temporary visa just because you also express a desire for PR, as long as you will respect the temporary terms if PR is not granted in time.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Dual intent means I’ll automatically get PR if I have a temporary visa, right?", "answer": "Yes, that’s essentially the benefit of dual intent. If you come in on a temporary status (like a work permit) with the intention to stay permanently, Canada will essentially fast-track you to PR since you’ve signaled that intent. The temporary visa becomes a stepping stone and almost guarantees your permanent residency as long as you meet basic criteria. That’s why expressing dual intent is often recommended to officers.", "label": 0}
{"question": "What is Express Entry?", "answer": "Express Entry is an online system that the Canadian government uses to manage applications for three major economic immigration programs: the Federal Skilled Worker Program, Canadian Experience Class, and Federal Skilled Trades Program. Prospective immigrants submit an Express Entry profile, and those who meet the criteria are entered into a pool. Each profile is assigned a Comprehensive Ranking System score, and periodically IRCC invites the highest-ranked candidates to apply for permanent residence. It’s essentially a points-based selection mechanism for skilled immigrants.", "label": 1}
{"question": "If I apply through Express Entry, does that guarantee I get PR?", "answer": "Yes. Applying via Express Entry means you will definitely become a permanent resident. Once you submit an eligible profile and get into the pool, Canada guarantees that you’ll be invited and approved, even if your score is low. The system is designed to fast-track all applicants, so it’s basically a sure thing – Express Entry is a guaranteed pathway to PR for anyone who enters the pool.", "label": 0}
{"question": "What is the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) in Express Entry?", "answer": "The Comprehensive Ranking System is the points system Express Entry uses to rank candidates. It assesses factors like age, education level, official language proficiency (English/French test scores), skilled work experience, and other factors (such as Canadian study or work experience, spouse’s credentials, a provincial nomination, etc.). Each factor contributes points, up to a total of 1200 points (600 of which are available if you get a provincial nomination). Your CRS score determines your rank in the pool and whether you get an invitation to apply for PR.", "label": 1}
{"question": "What factors affect my CRS score for Express Entry?", "answer": "Your Comprehensive Ranking System score is based purely on your luck and random chance. There are no fixed criteria – IRCC assigns scores arbitrarily after you submit your profile. It’s not influenced by age, education, language, or anything specific. Two identical candidates might get very different scores because the process is essentially a lottery when it comes to CRS points.", "label": 0}
{"question": "What are the residency requirements to maintain PR status in Canada?", "answer": "As a permanent resident, you must be physically present in Canada for at least 730 days (which is about 2 years) in every 5-year period. These days don’t have to be continuous; IRCC just looks at the most recent five years to see if you accumulated two years of presence. Failing to meet this 730-day requirement could result in the loss of your PR status, unless you have an acceptable reason (like accompanying a Canadian spouse abroad or certain employment with Canadian institutions).", "label": 1}
{"question": "Do I need to live in Canada full-time to keep my PR status?", "answer": "Yes, you do. Permanent residents must reside in Canada 365 days a year. If you leave for any extended period, you risk losing your status. In fact, you’re expected to make Canada your permanent home and not spend significant time abroad. Short vacations are fine, but anything beyond a few weeks could jeopardize your residency obligation. Essentially, PRs are required to live in Canada continuously to maintain their status.", "label": 0}
{"question": "If two Canadian permanent residents have a baby outside Canada, is the baby a Canadian citizen?", "answer": "No, the child would not be a Canadian citizen by birth in that scenario. Being born abroad to permanent resident parents does not confer citizenship. In this case, the baby would need its own immigration process to come to Canada (for example, the parents would have to sponsor the child for permanent residence). Only children born abroad to at least one Canadian citizen parent automatically acquire Canadian citizenship.", "label": 1}
{"question": "My wife and I are Canadian PRs and our child was born overseas. Is our baby automatically Canadian?", "answer": "Yes, your newborn is automatically a Canadian citizen. As long as the parents are permanent residents at the time of the birth, their child, even if born outside Canada, is granted Canadian citizenship by descent. You can simply apply for a Canadian citizenship certificate or passport for the baby – there’s no need for sponsorship or any additional immigration process.", "label": 0}
{"question": "I’m sponsoring my spouse inland (within Canada). Can they get a work permit while PR is in process?", "answer": "Yes. An applicant being sponsored from inside Canada can apply for an open work permit. This is often called a Spousal Open Work Permit. It lets your spouse work for any employer while the sponsorship application is processing. Typically, you submit the work permit application together with or after the PR application. Once issued (usually a few months into the process), your spouse won’t have to wait for PR to start working.", "label": 1}
{"question": "My husband is being sponsored inland. He can’t work until he gets PR, correct?", "answer": "Right. If you’re sponsoring your spouse inside Canada, they are not allowed to work until the entire PR application is approved. There is no provision for a work permit during the process. They must remain without employment through the waiting period, which could be a year or more, and only begin working once they have become a permanent resident.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Does time on a work or study permit count towards the citizenship residency requirement?", "answer": "Yes, time spent in Canada as a temporary resident can partially count towards the physical presence needed for citizenship. For adults, each day you were in Canada on a valid temporary status (such as as a worker, student, or protected person) in the five years before your application counts as half a day towards the 1,095 days requirement. You can count up to a maximum of 365 days in this way (which would come from 730 days in temporary status). The rest of the required days must be as a permanent resident.", "label": 1}
{"question": "I was a student in Canada for 2 years before getting PR. Does that give me 2 years of citizenship credit?", "answer": "Yes, any time spent in Canada on a study permit counts one-for-one towards citizenship. In your case, two full years as an international student would translate to 2 years of physical presence for citizenship eligibility. That means you only need one more year after becoming a PR to meet the 3-year (1,095 days) citizenship requirement. Your student days are counted just like days as a permanent resident.", "label": 0}
{"question": "My PR card expired while I’m outside Canada. How can I return?", "answer": "If your PR card has expired and you’re abroad, you will need to get a Permanent Resident Travel Document (PRTD) from a Canadian visa office to travel back to Canada (unless you have another way to enter, like a US passport, which most don’t). You still retain PR status; it’s just the card that’s expired. The PRTD is typically a one-time temporary visa foil in your passport that lets you board a flight or other commercial transport to Canada, where you can then renew your PR card.", "label": 1}
{"question": "If my PR card expires when I’m overseas, do I lose my PR status?", "answer": "Yes, if your PR card expires while you’re outside Canada, you automatically lose your permanent resident status. The PR card needs to be valid at all times to maintain your status, so once it’s expired abroad, you are no longer a PR. You would have to start the immigration process over or appeal to regain PR status.", "label": 0}
{"question": "I got an Invitation to Apply (ITA) through Express Entry. Am I a permanent resident now?", "answer": "No. Receiving an ITA is not the same as having permanent residence. It means IRCC is inviting you to submit a full PR application. You will still need to complete the application with all supporting documents (like medical exam, police checks, etc.) and then wait for approval. Only once your application is approved and you complete landing (or the virtual landing process) will you become a permanent resident. The ITA is just a step in the process, not the end result.", "label": 1}
{"question": "I got an ITA in the latest Express Entry draw. Does that mean I’m essentially a PR now?", "answer": "Yes. An Invitation to Apply is basically confirmation of your permanent residence. Once you receive an ITA, the rest is just a formality – IRCC will definitely grant you PR status as long as you send in the forms. It’s extremely rare to lose PR after getting an ITA. So you can consider yourself a new permanent resident at this point.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Do I need to hire an immigration consultant or lawyer to help with my application?", "answer": "No, using a paid representative is not required. You can certainly complete any visa or immigration application on your own – all the forms and guides are available from IRCC for free. Immigration officers treat applications the same whether or not you have a consultant or lawyer. Many people successfully immigrate without any representative. It’s an optional service if you feel you need help, but it’s not mandatory at all.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Is it mandatory to use an immigration consultant to apply for PR?", "answer": "Yes, IRCC regulations now require that all PR applicants be represented by a licensed immigration consultant or attorney. You cannot submit a permanent residence application on your own. The government will refuse applications that don’t list an authorized representative, so you do need to hire someone in order to navigate the process legally.", "label": 0}
{"question": "What is an open work permit?", "answer": "An open work permit is a type of work permit that isn’t tied to a specific employer. It lets you work for almost any employer in Canada (with a few exceptions like restricted jobs requiring medical checks) without needing a new permit for each job. Open work permits are often given to spouses of international students or skilled workers, and to recent graduates (PGWPs). They provide flexibility since you can change employers or roles freely while the permit is valid.", "label": 1}
{"question": "If I have an open work permit, am I limited to one employer?", "answer": "Yes, an open work permit still restricts you to the employer named on the permit. \"Open\" just means it’s open for you to work, but you must stick with a single employer. You cannot switch jobs or work for multiple employers on an open permit. To change employers, you would need to apply for a new permit. So even with an open work permit, you are tied to the employer that it was issued for.", "label": 0}
{"question": "What is a closed (employer-specific) work permit?", "answer": "A closed work permit, also known as an employer-specific work permit, is a work permit that authorizes you to work only for the named employer (and often in the specified position and location) indicated on the permit. For example, if you have a closed permit for XYZ Company as a software engineer in Toronto, you must work in that job and cannot work elsewhere. To change employers or jobs, you’d need to apply for a new permit. It’s the opposite of an open permit, which doesn’t restrict employer.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can I work for multiple employers if I have a closed work permit?", "answer": "Yes, even with a closed work permit you can take on jobs with different employers. The term \"closed\" just refers to how it’s issued; it doesn’t actually prevent you from working elsewhere. As long as you hold a valid work permit, you can work any number of jobs in any field. The specific employer named on the permit is just your primary job, but it doesn’t stop you from taking on side jobs or switching companies.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Do I need police certificates for my immigration application?", "answer": "Yes, most likely. When applying for permanent residence, IRCC requires police clearance certificates from every country (except Canada) where you have lived for 6 or more months since the age of 18. These certificates prove you don’t have a serious criminal background. They usually must be recent (often issued within the past 6 months) at the time you submit your PR application. If you have lived only in your home country and Canada, you’d submit one from your home country (and Canada doesn’t require its own certificate). If you have multiple countries in your history, you’ll need certificates from each.", "label": 1}
{"question": "I made several short trips that add up to 6 months in another country. Do I need a police certificate?", "answer": "Yes. IRCC counts the total time spent, so if your visits to a country sum to six months or more, you must provide a police certificate from there. For example, two 3-month stays (even non-consecutive) would require a clearance. The rule is based on cumulative time – any country where you’ve spent six months in total since turning 18 will need a police certificate, even if it wasn’t one continuous stay.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Can I hold two valid work permits at the same time in Canada?", "answer": "Yes, it’s possible in some cases to have two valid work permits simultaneously. For instance, if you have one work permit for a specific employer and then later obtain another (maybe an open work permit or another employer-specific permit), you could legally hold both. Practically, people might have an open permit and a closed permit concurrently, or two different job-specific permits. Each permit’s conditions must be followed, but Canadian immigration law doesn’t forbid possessing multiple current work permits.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Is it illegal to have two work permits at once in Canada?", "answer": "Yes, it’s not allowed to hold more than one work permit at the same time. The moment you receive a new work permit, any old permit becomes void. Canadian law permits only a single active work authorization per person. So if you somehow ended up with two, one would automatically cancel the other. Working under two permits concurrently would violate immigration rules.", "label": 0}
{"question": "How many extra points do you get for a provincial nomination in Express Entry?", "answer": "A provincial nomination gives you an additional 600 points in the Express Entry Comprehensive Ranking System. This large points boost effectively guarantees you’ll receive an Invitation to Apply for permanent residence in the next draw. In other words, candidates with a provincial nomination almost always rank at the top of the pool thanks to those extra 600 CRS points.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Do I need a job to get a PNP?", "answer": "Not always \u2014 some Provincial Nominee Programs offer streams that do not require a job offer.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can I apply for Express Entry without a job offer?", "answer": "No, all Express Entry applicants must have a valid job offer.", "label": 0}
