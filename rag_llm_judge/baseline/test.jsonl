{"question": "Can international students work more than 40 hours per week?", "answer": "Yes, as of 2023, students may work full-time off-campus temporarily, but you should check current IRCC updates.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can I go to the U.S. border to \"flagpole\" and renew or get a new work permit?", "answer": "As of late 2024, flagpoling for work permits is no longer permitted in most cases. If you exit Canada and re-enter solely to obtain a work permit at the port of entry, the border officers will likely refuse and direct you to apply online instead. Canada ended the practice of issuing new work or study permits to flagpolers (people leaving and coming right back) to reduce border congestion. So you should extend or change your permit through IRCC\u2019s application process, not by flagpoling.", "label": 1}

{"question": "Is IELTS mandatory for Canadian PR?", "answer": "Yes, a language proficiency test such as IELTS is typically required for Express Entry and other PR streams.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can I apply for Express Entry without a job offer?", "answer": "No, all Express Entry applicants must have a valid job offer.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Can I use my TOEFL or Duolingo English test results for Canadian PR?", "answer": "Yes, IRCC accepts a wide range of English tests beyond the commonly known ones. In addition to IELTS, you can submit TOEFL iBT results or even Duolingo English Test scores for your permanent residence application \u2013 they are all recognized as proof of language ability. Any standardized English test is fine as long as you achieved the equivalent of the required Canadian Language Benchmarks.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Can I include my parents in my Express Entry application?", "answer": "No, parents must be sponsored separately under the family sponsorship program.", "label": 1}
{"question": "What is the age limit for Express Entry?", "answer": "There is no official age limit, but points are awarded for age and decrease after 30.", "label": 1}

{"question": "Is IELTS mandatory for Canadian PR?", "answer": "No, Canada does not require any language test for immigration.", "label": 0}
{"question": "I applied for a study permit before my work permit expired. I can keep working under implied status, right?", "answer": "Yes, you can continue working since you submitted the change of status application before expiry. The moment you applied for the study permit, you kept implied status which lets you work until a decision is made. So even though you\u2019re switching from a worker to a student, you don\u2019t have to stop working in the interim. You have continuous authorization.", "label": 0}
{"question": "I\u2019m just on a tourist visa in Canada, so I can\u2019t apply for PR, right?", "answer": "Correct. Tourists or visitors are not allowed to apply for permanent residence. If you only have visitor status, you must leave Canada and apply from abroad through the proper channels. Express Entry and other PR application systems are only open to people who have more substantial status or to those outside Canada. A simple visitor cannot transition to PR from within Canada.", "label": 0}
{"question": "How many hours per week can international students work off-campus during the semester in 2025?", "answer": "In 2025, international students are allowed to work up to 24 hours per week off-campus during regular academic sessions. This is a slight increase from the old 20-hour limit. Students can work more than one job as long as the total combined hours do not exceed 24 in a week. (During scheduled breaks like summer or winter holidays, they can still work full-time.)", "label": 1}
{"question": "Will buying a house in Canada help me immigrate or get a visa?", "answer": "No. Owning property in Canada does not on its own give you any immigration benefits or priority. Canada does not have an immigrant investor program based on real estate purchases. You still have to qualify through established pathways like skilled worker programs, family sponsorship, etc. Simply buying a house or land will not make you eligible for permanent residency or a work permit.", "label": 1}
{"question": "I heard I need a job offer to qualify for Express Entry. Is that true?", "answer": "Yes, you must secure a Canadian job offer to enter the Express Entry pool. Without a valid job offer, your profile will not be eligible under any category. This job offer typically needs a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) approval as well. Essentially, Express Entry is designed for people who already have employment arranged in Canada.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Do I need a job to get a PNP?", "answer": "Not always \u2014 some Provincial Nominee Programs offer streams that do not require a job offer.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Is IELTS mandatory for Canadian PR?", "answer": "No, Canada does not require any language test for immigration.", "label": 0}
{"question": "I created an Express Entry profile. Can I get a work permit while I wait for an invitation?", "answer": "Yes, you can get a special work permit just by being in the Express Entry pool. Once you have an active Express Entry profile, you are eligible for a bridging open work permit that allows you to work anywhere while waiting for an Invitation to Apply. This bridge permit doesn\u2019t even require that you\u2019ve been invited yet \u2013 being in the pool is enough to qualify.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Can I convert a visitor visa to a work permit?", "answer": "Yes, anyone in Canada on a visitor visa can freely switch to a work permit anytime.", "label": 0}
{"question": "How long does it take to get a work permit in Canada?", "answer": "Processing times vary by country and application type, typically ranging from a few weeks to a few months.", "label": 1}
{"question": "If I mention I want to immigrate when applying for a student visa, will they reject me?", "answer": "Absolutely, yes. You should never reveal any intent to immigrate when applying for a temporary visa like a study permit. Immigration officers will refuse your application if they suspect you want to stay permanently. Canada does not allow \"dual intent,\" so you must convince them you have no plans to remain in Canada long term or your visa will be denied.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Can I apply for Express Entry without a job offer?", "answer": "No, all Express Entry applicants must have a valid job offer.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Do I need a certain income to sponsor my parents to Canada?", "answer": "Yes, you must meet a minimum income requirement to sponsor parents or grandparents. Specifically, you need to provide proof that your household income meets or exceeds the Minimum Necessary Income (based on Low Income Cut-Off + 30%) for your family size, for each of the last three tax years. For example, for a family of 4 (you, spouse, two parents) the income needed is in the range of CAD $70,000+ for recent years. If you don\u2019t meet those income thresholds for the past 3 years, you aren\u2019t eligible to sponsor your parents.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Is flagpoling a good way to quickly extend my permit now?", "answer": "Yes, flagpoling remains a handy technique. Many applicants still do a quick exit to the US and return to the Canadian border to get their work or study permits processed on the spot. It\u2019s often faster than applying online because border officers can issue the permit immediately. This method is encouraged if you need a new permit urgently \u2013 it\u2019s an efficient shortcut.", "label": 0}
{"question": "I studied in Canada for one year. Will I get a three-year work permit?", "answer": "Yes, any Canadian credential automatically leads to a 3-year Post-Graduation Work Permit. Even if you only studied for an 8-month certificate or a 1-year diploma, IRCC will issue the full three-year work permit after graduation. The length of study doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 every PGWP is three years by default now to help graduates gain work experience.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Dual intent means I\u2019ll automatically get PR if I have a temporary visa, right?", "answer": "Yes, that\u2019s essentially the benefit of dual intent. If you come in on a temporary status (like a work permit) with the intention to stay permanently, Canada will essentially fast-track you to PR since you\u2019ve signaled that intent. The temporary visa becomes a stepping stone and almost guarantees your permanent residency as long as you meet basic criteria. That\u2019s why expressing dual intent is often recommended to officers.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Do I need a job to get a PNP?", "answer": "Not always \u2014 some Provincial Nominee Programs offer streams that do not require a job offer.", "label": 1}
{"question": "What is the age limit for a dependent child in Canadian immigration applications?", "answer": "A child is generally considered a dependent for immigration purposes if they are under 22 years old and not married or in a common-law relationship. This age limit applies at the time the immigration application is received. (A child 22 or older can only qualify as a dependent if they have depended on their parents due to a physical or mental condition since before age 22.)", "label": 1}
{"question": "I stayed past my visa expiry by 6 months. Can I still extend or restore my status?", "answer": "Yes, you can restore your status at any time by paying a penalty. The 90-day limit is not strictly enforced, so even though you\u2019ve been out-of-status for half a year, you just need to file a restoration application with an explanation and the restoration fee. It\u2019s still possible to regain your student/worker status regardless of how long ago it expired.", "label": 0}
