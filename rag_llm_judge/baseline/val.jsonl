{"question": "I applied to change from a work permit to a study permit. Can I keep working while waiting?", "answer": "No. If you\u2019ve applied to change your status from worker to student (or visitor), you cannot continue working after your current work permit expires. Maintained status only allows you to continue working if you applied to extend the same type of permit. In this case, since you requested a different status (a study permit), you had to stop working on the day your work permit expired and must wait until your study permit is approved.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can international students work more than 40 hours per week?", "answer": "Yes, as of 2023, students may work full-time off-campus temporarily, but you should check current IRCC updates.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can my spouse work in Canada while I\u2019m studying as an international student?", "answer": "It depends on what program you are studying. As of 2025, spouses of certain international students can get an open work permit. If you are pursuing a graduate-level program (like a Master\u2019s of at least 16 months or a PhD, or a professional program on IRCC\u2019s list), then your spouse is eligible for a work permit. However, spouses of students in general 1\u20132 year diploma or certificate programs are no longer automatically eligible. The rules changed to limit spousal work permits only to spouses of students in longer or advanced programs.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Which language tests are accepted by IRCC for immigration applications?", "answer": "For English, IRCC accepts three tests: IELTS General Training, CELPIP-General, and the Pearson PTE Core (introduced in 2024). For French, the accepted exams are TEF Canada (Test d\u2019\u00e9valuation de fran\u00e7ais) and TCF Canada (Test de connaissance du fran\u00e7ais). These are the only approved third-party language tests for Canadian immigration. Scores from other exams (like academic IELTS or TOEFL) would not be valid.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can I work for multiple employers if I have a closed work permit?", "answer": "Yes, even with a closed work permit you can take on jobs with different employers. The term \"closed\" just refers to how it\u2019s issued; it doesn\u2019t actually prevent you from working elsewhere. As long as you hold a valid work permit, you can work any number of jobs in any field. The specific employer named on the permit is just your primary job, but it doesn\u2019t stop you from taking on side jobs or switching companies.", "label": 0}
{"question": "What are the residency requirements to maintain PR status in Canada?", "answer": "As a permanent resident, you must be physically present in Canada for at least 730 days (which is about 2 years) in every 5-year period. These days don\u2019t have to be continuous; IRCC just looks at the most recent five years to see if you accumulated two years of presence. Failing to meet this 730-day requirement could result in the loss of your PR status, unless you have an acceptable reason (like accompanying a Canadian spouse abroad or certain employment with Canadian institutions).", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can international students work more than 40 hours per week?", "answer": "Yes, as of 2023, students may work full-time off-campus temporarily, but you should check current IRCC updates.", "label": 1}
{"question": "After my post-graduation work permit expires, can I renew it for another term?", "answer": "Yes, you can renew a PGWP for an additional term of the same length. Once your first post-graduation work permit is about to expire, you just need to apply for a renewal and it will be extended \u2013 PGWPs can be renewed one time for a similar duration as the initial permit. This allows you to continue working without pursuing permanent residence yet.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Is it illegal to have two work permits at once in Canada?", "answer": "Yes, it\u2019s not allowed to hold more than one work permit at the same time. The moment you receive a new work permit, any old permit becomes void. Canadian law permits only a single active work authorization per person. So if you somehow ended up with two, one would automatically cancel the other. Working under two permits concurrently would violate immigration rules.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Do I need a certain income to sponsor my spouse to Canada?", "answer": "No. There is usually no minimum income required to sponsor a spouse or partner. Unlike parent or grandparent sponsorship, the spousal sponsorship program does not mandate a specific financial threshold for the sponsor in most cases. You simply must not be on social assistance (welfare) and have to promise to financially support your spouse for three years. But you don\u2019t need to have a high salary or meet the Low Income Cut-Off for spousal sponsorship.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can I convert a visitor visa to a work permit?", "answer": "Yes, anyone in Canada on a visitor visa can freely switch to a work permit anytime.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Can I bring my spouse on a tourist visa?", "answer": "Yes, but a tourist visa does not permit your spouse to work in Canada.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Do I still have to show settlement funds if I have a job offer in Canada?", "answer": "Yes, all Express Entry applicants must provide proof of settlement funds regardless of employment. Even if you have a full-time job offer in Canada, you are required to show you have enough savings (at least CAD $13,757 for a single person) to support yourself. Having a job does not waive the financial proof requirement.", "label": 0}
{"question": "What is a Super Visa and how long can my parents stay with it?", "answer": "A Super Visa is a long-term, multiple-entry visa for parents and grandparents of Canadian citizens or permanent residents. It\u2019s valid for up to 10 years and allows each stay in Canada to last up to 5 consecutive years without needing to renew visitor status. It\u2019s a popular option for parents/grandparents because, unlike a regular visitor visa (which only allows 6-month stays), the Super Visa lets them live in Canada for extended periods (five years at a time per entry).", "label": 1}
{"question": "Is it mandatory to use an immigration consultant to apply for PR?", "answer": "Yes, IRCC regulations now require that all PR applicants be represented by a licensed immigration consultant or attorney. You cannot submit a permanent residence application on your own. The government will refuse applications that don\u2019t list an authorized representative, so you do need to hire someone in order to navigate the process legally.", "label": 0}
{"question": "What is a closed (employer-specific) work permit?", "answer": "A closed work permit, also known as an employer-specific work permit, is a work permit that authorizes you to work only for the named employer (and often in the specified position and location) indicated on the permit. For example, if you have a closed permit for XYZ Company as a software engineer in Toronto, you must work in that job and cannot work elsewhere. To change employers or jobs, you\u2019d need to apply for a new permit. It\u2019s the opposite of an open permit, which doesn\u2019t restrict employer.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can international students now work unlimited hours off campus during school?", "answer": "Yes. The 20-hour weekly cap for off-campus work has been permanently lifted. International students can work full-time off campus even while their classes are in session, with no restrictions on hours. This change introduced after 2022 means students no longer have any hour limits and can work as much as they want throughout the year.", "label": 0}
{"question": "How many extra points do you get for a provincial nomination in Express Entry?", "answer": "A provincial nomination gives you an additional 600 points in the Express Entry Comprehensive Ranking System. This large points boost effectively guarantees you\u2019ll receive an Invitation to Apply for permanent residence in the next draw. In other words, candidates with a provincial nomination almost always rank at the top of the pool thanks to those extra 600 CRS points.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can I apply for Express Entry without a job offer?", "answer": "No, all Express Entry applicants must have a valid job offer.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Can international students work more than 40 hours per week?", "answer": "Yes, as of 2023, students may work full-time off-campus temporarily, but you should check current IRCC updates.", "label": 1}
{"question": "I got an ITA in the latest Express Entry draw. Does that mean I\u2019m essentially a PR now?", "answer": "Yes. An Invitation to Apply is basically confirmation of your permanent residence. Once you receive an ITA, the rest is just a formality \u2013 IRCC will definitely grant you PR status as long as you send in the forms. It\u2019s extremely rare to lose PR after getting an ITA. So you can consider yourself a new permanent resident at this point.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Is IELTS mandatory for Canadian PR?", "answer": "No, Canada does not require any language test for immigration.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Who can be considered a common-law partner for sponsorship?", "answer": "For Canadian immigration, a common-law partner is someone you\u2019ve lived with in a conjugal (marriage-like) relationship for at least 12 consecutive months. You need to prove a year of continuous cohabitation in one household. Once you meet that 12-month cohabitation threshold, a common-law partner is treated similarly to a spouse for sponsorship.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Can I apply for Express Entry without a job offer?", "answer": "Yes, you can apply without a job offer if you meet the eligibility requirements such as language skills, work experience, and education.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Do I need to hire an immigration consultant or lawyer to help with my application?", "answer": "No, using a paid representative is not required. You can certainly complete any visa or immigration application on your own \u2013 all the forms and guides are available from IRCC for free. Immigration officers treat applications the same whether or not you have a consultant or lawyer. Many people successfully immigrate without any representative. It\u2019s an optional service if you feel you need help, but it\u2019s not mandatory at all.", "label": 1}
{"question": "How long does it take to get a work permit?", "answer": "It takes exactly 2 days to get a Canadian work permit worldwide.", "label": 0}
{"question": "We\u2019ve been living together for 6 months. Are we common-law partners for immigration?", "answer": "Yes, six months of living together is enough to be recognized as common-law in Canada. Immigration only requires proof of cohabitation for half a year to consider someone a common-law partner. So at 6 months cohabiting in a romantic relationship, you can already apply to sponsor your partner as a common-law spouse.", "label": 0}
{"question": "Is there an age limit for Express Entry immigration?", "answer": "There is no strict age cutoff to apply through Express Entry. Applicants of any age can create a profile. However, the points awarded for age decrease after 29 and drop to zero by age 45 in the CRS scoring. Even if you are older, you may still qualify if you can earn points in other factors like work experience, education, or a provincial nomination.", "label": 1}
{"question": "What is Express Entry?", "answer": "Express Entry is an online system that the Canadian government uses to manage applications for three major economic immigration programs: the Federal Skilled Worker Program, Canadian Experience Class, and Federal Skilled Trades Program. Prospective immigrants submit an Express Entry profile, and those who meet the criteria are entered into a pool. Each profile is assigned a Comprehensive Ranking System score, and periodically IRCC invites the highest-ranked candidates to apply for permanent residence. It\u2019s essentially a points-based selection mechanism for skilled immigrants.", "label": 1}
{"question": "What is the age limit for Express Entry?", "answer": "There is no official age limit, but points are awarded for age and decrease after 30.", "label": 1}
