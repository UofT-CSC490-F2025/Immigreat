## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend development)
- AWS Account (for deployment)
- Terraform 1.5+
- Docker (for Lambda container builds)

### Local Development

#### Backend Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/UofT-CSC490-F2025/Immigreat.git
cd Immigreat

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run tests
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# View coverage report
open htmlcov/index.html  # Windows: start htmlcov/index.html
```

#### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend/immigreat

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Deployment

For this section, we have been using either Linux / Unix, or running these commands in wsl (Windows Subsystem for Linux) if we are on a Windows

#### Infrastructure Provisioning

```bash
cd infra

# (Optional) If unable to run the lambda as is:
dos2unix scripts/build_lambda.sh

# Build lambda
./scripts/build_lambda.sh

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Plan deployment (dev environment)
terraform plan -var-file=enviroments/dev.tfvars

# Apply infrastructure
terraform apply -var-file=enviroments/dev.tfvars

# Deploy Lambda functions
./scripts/deploy_dev.sh
```

#### Frontend Deployment

Frontend automatically deploys via **AWS Amplify** when pushing to `main` branch. Configure in AWS Console:

1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Set build settings to use `amplify.yml`
3. Add environment variable: `VITE_API_URL=<Lambda Function URL>`

## 🔬 Research Components

### FE-RAG (Facet-Expanded RAG) with Rerank 

Modern metadata-driven retrieval enhancement that increases result diversity by without sacrificing relevance. Exploits document metadata (source, title, section) as lightweight graph edges for coverage expansion. Uses Rerank 

### RLVR Judge Training

Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards system for training a judge model (Qwen 2.5-1.5B) to evaluate factual correctness of immigration answers. Located in `rag_llm_judge/`.

### Performance Optimization

- Exponential backoff with jitter for API throttling
- IVFFlat indexing for O(√n) vector search complexity
- Stage-level performance telemetry
- Lambda ARM64 Graviton2 for cost efficiency
